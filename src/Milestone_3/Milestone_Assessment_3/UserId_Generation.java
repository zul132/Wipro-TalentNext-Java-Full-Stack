  Complete the given function to generate a User ID for an online gaming competition that takes 4 arguments - first name, last name, PIN and a digit N.

  Rule 1: The smaller length name is taken as Smaller_Name and the larger name is taken as Larger_Name. If the two names are of equal length,
  then the name which comes first in alphabetical order is taken as Smaller_Name while the other name is taken as Larger_Name.

  Rule 2: The user ID is formed as follows:
          last letter of Smaller_Name + whole Larger_Name + Nth digit of PIN read from Left to Right + Nth digit of PIN from Right to Left.

  Rule 3: Once the above format is constructed, toggle the letters i.e. Lowercase letters are converted to Capital, and vice-versa.
          Return the resultant String as the user ID.

    Sample Input: Rajiv, Roy, 564859, 2
